The ratio of the points in the quarter circle to the total amount of points would be pi/4. This means that if we want to
find the value of pi we would multiply that ratio by 4.

Code Output:

There are: 4000000000 points in total. There are: 3141571324 points in the circle. The ratio between the points in the
circle and total points is 0.785392831. This is the approximate value of pi/4. This means that the approximate value of pi
is 3.141571324
